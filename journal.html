      <h1>welcome to my journal!</h1>
      <p>i don't know how often i'll write here, but i'll try to do it as much as i can!</p>

      <h2>hiii</h2>
      <h3>jul 30, 2024</h3>
      <p>i meant to update this somewhat frequently, but it seems like for the foreseeable future this will just 
        be a "whenever i think about it" type thing... whatever, i enjoy doing this when i do! i went back to the 
        states this summer to visit my dad, and i had a pretty good time. we went to sonic symphony in minneapolis,
        and holy fuck it was cool... anyway, that project i mentioned last time is probably gonna be on the
        backburner for quite a while. i still want to make it but i think for my mental health, it's best if i
        continue to work on some smaller projects that i don't feel the need to release or fully develop.
        <br><br>
        all that aside i've been wanting to work on some non-game projects that i could release for more people
        to experience. i don't have any set plans yet and i don't know that i ever will, but i think working on
        something that i can just put time into and then release rather than having to actively develop something
        could be fun! :)</p>

      <h2>long overdue update</h2>
      <h3>mar 5, 2024</h3>
      <p>hello! it's been quite a bit of time since i've updated this. oops! i've been working on some
        stuff. i meant to write this earlier, but i just sorta forgot.<br><br>
        anyway, i published my <a href="https://unwillingpish.itch.io/whats-behind-the-door">first game!</a>
        it's just a small game that i pumped out for the brackeys jam. i had a lot of fun working on it, though,
        and im thinking about maybe updating it a bit in the future! i wasn't able to get as much done as i had
        hoped, since i joined a day late, and missed another day, but i was at least able to get a finished game
        out and released.<br><br>
        anyway, i also went to venice last month! i had a pretty good time. venice is beautiful. i would like to
        incorporate venetian architecture into a game at some point. but right now, im working on another project. 
        the working title is "critical mass." im excited to see where it goes. i won't say much about it until i
        get at least a short gameplay video to show my vision, but it's definitely going to be a longer project.
        i'll probably have to work on some smaller projects in between some breaks, because i've noticed i get
        sort of restless when it comes to gamedev.

      <h2>first entry!</h2>
      <h3>feb 8, 2024</h3>
      <p>the first entry to my journal! i wanted to do this since i created the website, but i got
        preoccupied with other stuff and sort of abandoned it. but it's finally here!<br><br>
        in other words, i've been learning a lot with godot! 
        i've been using it for ~2-3 years now, but i've been getting into more advanced stuff. 
        i've successfully made a multiplayer game, as well as implementing text and voice chat. 
        i also discovered <a href="https://github.com/stechyo/godot-steam-audio">this</a> plugin for godot, 
        which adds really nice spatial audio (with occlusion!) via valve's steam audio sdk. 
        <br><br>
        i think games for me and my friends to play has helped make game development a lot more fun for me 
        (not that it wasn't fun before, but having my friends playtest gives me more incentive to actually 
        improve and expand upon them)
