      <h2>first entry!</h2>
      <h3>feb 8, 2024</h3>
      <p>the first entry to my journal! i wanted to do this since i created the website, but i got
        preoccupied with other stuff and sort of abandoned it. but it's finally here!<br>
        in other words, i've been learning a lot with godot! 
        i've been using it for ~2-3 years now, but i've been getting into more advanced stuff. 
        i've successfully made a multiplayer game, as well as implementing text and voice chat. 
        i also discovered <a href="https://github.com/stechyo/godot-steam-audio">this</a> plugin for godot, 
        which adds really nice spatial audio (with occlusion!) via valve's steam audio sdk. 
        <br>
        i think games for me and my friends to play has helped make game development a lot more fun for me 
        (not that it wasn't fun before, but having my friends playtest gives me more incentive to actually 
        improve and expand upon them)
